# Web_Server_with_SQL_Service

This app is implemented a multi-threaded Web server that responds to
Web page requests across the network from an Internet Explorer (IE) client.
The Web server also implements a database service that will allow Web
pages to submit input to SQL queries and display text results that are formatted
as a web page.
